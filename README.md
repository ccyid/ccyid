### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science. I have a profound appreciation for classical music. This passion serves as a beautiful escape as well as fuels my creativity and analytical thinking in my studies and research. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals who share similar interests in technology and the arts. Let's exchange ideas and inspire each other!
